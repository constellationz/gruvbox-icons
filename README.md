# Gruvbox Icon Theme

This icon set is forked from adhe's gruvbox icon theme located at [https://www.opencode.net/adhe/gruvboxplasma](https://www.opencode.net/adhe/gruvboxplasma).

The original application icons are from the Papirus icon set [github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme](github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) [pling.com](https://www.pling.com/p/1166289/).

All other icons are inherited from the Papirus-Dark theme, which should be installed alongside this one.

## Additional Fixes

- The folders are structured closer to Papirus
- Small icons with incorrect scaling were removed and replaced with scaled versions of the larger icons
